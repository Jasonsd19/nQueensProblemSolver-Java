# nQueensProblemSolver-Java

Similar to the Sudoku Solver, this n-Queens problem solver is something that I worked on years ago. It was one of my first Programming projects. I made use of both
generative recursion and backtracking, I wanted to see how these concepts worked in Java. I also tried my best to implement some text based UI to make it more user
friendly.
